## User with Nested Addresses

We want to get the user information, with all of their addresses returned (*if any*) as an array.

##### Query

```sql
SELECT u.user_id, u.first_name, u.last_name,
    ARRAY {
            "address_1": address.address_1,
            "address_2": address.address_2,
            "region": address.region,
            "country": address.country,
            "postal_code": address.postal_code,
            "locality": address.locality
        } FOR address IN IFMISSING(addresses, [])
    END AS addresses
FROM users AS u
USE KEYS 'user_123'
LEFT NEST users AS addresses ON KEYS (
    ARRAY a.address_id FOR a IN (
        SELECT 'address_' || address_id AS address_id
        FROM users AS address_lookup
        USE KEYS 'user_' || TOSTRING(u.user_id) || '_addresses'
        UNNEST address_lookup.addresses AS address_id
    ) END
