## Airport Navaids by Code

##### Query

This query will find the available frequencies by the 3 character IATA / FAA code of the airport

[airport_navaids_by_iata_code.n1ql](queries/airport_navaids/airport_navaids_by_iata_code.n1ql)

```sql
SELECT navaids.navaid_id, navaids.navaid_ident, navaids.navaid_name, navaids.type,
    navaids.frequency_khz, navaids.geo, navaids.elevation, navaids.usage_type
FROM `flight-data` AS airport_codes
USE KEYS 'airport_code_SLN'
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS airport_navaids
    ON KEYS 'airport_' || TOSTRING( airport_codes.id ) || '_navaids'
UNNEST airport_navaids.navaids AS navaids_lookup
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS navaids
    ON KEYS 'navaid_' || TOSTRING( navaids_lookup )
ORDER BY navaids.navaid_name ASC
```

This query will find the available frequencies by the 4 character ICAO code of the airport

[airport_navaids_by_icao_code.n1ql](queries/airport_navaids/airport_navaids_by_icao_code.n1ql)

```sql
SELECT navaids.navaid_id, navaids.navaid_ident, navaids.navaid_name, navaids.type,
    navaids.frequency_khz, navaids.geo, navaids.elevation, navaids.usage_type
FROM `flight-data` AS airport_codes
USE KEYS 'airport_code_KSLN'
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS airport_navaids
    ON KEYS 'airport_' || TOSTRING( airport_codes.id ) || '_navaids'
UNNEST airport_navaids.navaids AS navaids_lookup
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS navaids
    ON KEYS 'navaid_' || TOSTRING( navaids_lookup )
ORDER BY navaids.navaid_name ASC
```

Both queries will yield the same exact result.

##### Result

```json
[
  {
    "elevation": 1315,
    "frequency_khz": 344,
    "geo": {
      "latitude": 38.68149948,
      "longitude": -97.64510345
    },
    "navaid_id": 93716,
    "navaid_ident": "SL",
    "navaid_name": "Flory",
    "type": "NDB",
    "usage_type": "TERMINAL"
  },
  {

    "frequency_khz": 117100,
    "geo": {
      "latitude": 38.92509842,
      "longitude": -97.62139893
    },
    "navaid_id": 93733,
    "navaid_ident": "SLN",
    "navaid_name": "Salina",
    "type": "VORTAC",
    "usage_type": "BOTH"
  }
]
```

## Airport Information with Navaids

For this query we want to retrieve a single record with the airport information with a single attribute that is an array of each of the airports navaids.

##### Query

This query will find the available navaids by the 3 character IATA / FAA code of the airport

[airport_with_navaids_by_iata_code.n1ql](queries/airport_runways/airport_with_navaids_by_iata_code.n1ql)

```sql
SELECT airports.airport_id, airports.airport_name, airports.airport_type,
    airports.iso_region, airports.municipality,
    IFNULL( airports.airport_iata, airports.airport_icao, airports.airport_ident ) AS airport_code,
    ARRAY
        {
          "elevation": navaid.elevation,
          "frequency_khz": navaid.frequency_khz,
          "geo": navaid.geo,
          "navaid_ident": navaid.navaid_ident,
          "type": navaid.`type`,
          "usage_type": navaid.usage_type
        }
        FOR navaid IN IFMISSING(navaids, [])
    END AS navaids
FROM `flight-data` AS codes
USE KEYS 'airport_code_ICT'
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS airports ON KEYS 'airport_' || TOSTRING( codes.id )
LEFT NEST `flight-data` AS navaids ON KEYS (
    ARRAY navaid.navaid_id FOR navaid IN (
        SELECT 'navaid_' || TOSTRING( navaid_id ) AS navaid_id
        FROM `flight-data` AS navaids_lookup
        USE KEYS
            'airport_' || TOSTRING(codes.id) || '_navaids'
        UNNEST navaids_lookup.navaids AS navaid_id
    ) END
)
```

This query will find the available navaids and information by the 4 character ICAO code of the airport

[airport_with_navaids_by_icao_code.n1ql](queries/airport_runways/airport_with_navaids_by_icao_code.n1ql)

```sql
SELECT airports.airport_id, airports.airport_name, airports.airport_type,
    airports.iso_region, airports.municipality,
    IFNULL( airports.airport_iata, airports.airport_icao, airports.airport_ident ) AS airport_code,
    ARRAY
        {
          "elevation": navaid.elevation,
          "frequency_khz": navaid.frequency_khz,
          "geo": navaid.geo,
          "navaid_ident": navaid.navaid_ident,
          "type": navaid.`type`,
          "usage_type": navaid.usage_type
        }
        FOR navaid IN IFMISSING(navaids, [])
    END AS navaids
FROM `flight-data` AS codes
USE KEYS 'airport_code_KICT'
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS airports ON KEYS 'airport_' || TOSTRING( codes.id )
LEFT NEST `flight-data` AS navaids ON KEYS (
    ARRAY navaid.navaid_id FOR navaid IN (
        SELECT 'navaid_' || TOSTRING( navaid_id ) AS navaid_id
        FROM `flight-data` AS navaids_lookup
        USE KEYS
            'airport_' || TOSTRING(codes.id) || '_navaids'
        UNNEST navaids_lookup.navaids AS navaid_id
    ) END
)
```

Both queries will yield the same exact result.
