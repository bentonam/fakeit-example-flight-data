# Airport Queries

These are example N1QL queries that may can performed to retrieve airport related data.

---

## Airport By ID

The following query will get an Airline by its Document ID.

##### Query

```sql
SELECT airports.*
FROM `flight-data` AS airports
USE KEYS 'airport_3605'
```

##### Result

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "airport_3605",
    "airport_gps_code": "KICT",
    "airport_iata": "ICT",
    "airport_icao": "KICT",
    "airport_id": 3605,
    "airport_ident": "KICT",
    "airport_local_code": "ICT",
    "airport_name": "Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport",
    "airport_type": "large_airport",
    "doc_type": "airport",
    "dst": "A",
    "elevation": 1333,
    "geo": {
      "latitude": 37.64989853,
      "longitude": -97.43309784
    },
    "iso_continent": "NA",
    "iso_country": "US",
    "iso_region": "US-KS",
    "municipality": "Wichita",
    "timezone": "America/Chicago",
    "timezone_offset": -6
  }
]
```

The following query will retrieve many Airlines by their ID.

##### Query

```sql
SELECT airports.*
FROM `flight-data` AS airports
USE KEYS ['airport_3605', 'airport_3568']
```

##### Result

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "airport_3605",
    "airport_gps_code": "KICT",
    "airport_iata": "ICT",
    "airport_icao": "KICT",
    "airport_id": 3605,
    "airport_ident": "KICT",
    "airport_local_code": "ICT",
    "airport_name": "Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport",
    "airport_type": "large_airport",
    "doc_type": "airport",

## Airports in a Country

The following index and queries allows for finding airports based in a given country by creating an index on the `iso_country` where the `doc_type` is `airport`

##### Index

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_airports_iso_country ON `flight-data`( iso_country )
WHERE doc_type = 'airport'
    AND iso_country IS NOT NULL
USING GSI
```

##### Query

```sql
SELECT airports.*
FROM `flight-data` AS airports
WHERE airports.iso_country = 'FI'
    AND airports.doc_type = 'airport'
LIMIT 1
```

##### Result

```json
[
  {
    "_id": "airport_2330",
    "airport_gps_code": "EFMA",
    "airport_iata": "MHQ",
    "airport_icao": "EFMA",
    "airport_id": 2330,
    "airport_ident": "EFMA",
    "airport_local_code": null,
    "airport_name": "Mariehamn",
    "airport_type": "medium_airport",
    "doc_type": "airport",
    "dst": "E",
    "elevation": 17,
    "geo": {
      "latitude": 60.12220001,
      "longitude": 19.89819908
    },
    "iso_continent": "EU",
    "iso_country": "FI",
    "iso_region": "FI-AL",
    "municipality": "Mariehamn",
    "timezone": "Europe/Mariehamn",
    "timezone_offset": 2
  }
]
```

Now that we know we can retrieve an airport in a country, lets retrieve all airports in a given country by querying on the `iso_country`, sorted by the `airport_name`

##### Query

```sql
SELECT airports.airport_id, airports.airport_name, airports.airport_type,
    airports.iso_region, airports.municipality,
    IFNULL( airports.airport_iata, airports.airport_icao, airports.airport_ident ) AS airport_code
FROM `flight-data` AS airports
WHERE airports.iso_country = 'AE'
    AND airports.doc_type = 'airport'
ORDER BY airports.airport_name ASC
```

##### Results

```json
[
  {
    "airport_code": "AUH",
    "airport_id": 5226,
    "airport_name": "Abu Dhabi Intl",
    "airport_type": "large_airport",
    "iso_region": "AE-AZ",
    "municipality": "Abu Dhabi"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "AAN",
    "airport_id": 5230,
    "airport_name": "Al Ain International Airport",
    "airport_type": "medium_airport",
    "iso_region": "AE-AZ",
    "municipality": "Al Ain"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "DHF",
    "airport_id": 5231,
    "airport_name": "Al Dhafra",
    "airport_type": "medium_airport",
    "iso_region": "AE-AZ",
    "municipality": "Abu Dhabi"
  },
  ...
]
```

Additionally we can retrieve an aggregate count of the number of airports in a given country.

##### Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(1) AS total_airports
FROM `flight-data` AS airports
WHERE airports.iso_country = 'FI'
    AND airports.doc_type = 'airport'
```

##### Result

```json
[
  {
    "total_airports": 50
  }
]
```

---

## Airports by Country and Region

Now that we know we can retrieve all airports in a given country by querying on the `iso_country` we can add the `iso_region` to further narrow the results.

##### Index

First we need to delete our previously created index and then create a new one.  The new index will index both `iso_country` and `iso_region`

```sql
DROP INDEX `flight-data`.idx_airports_iso_country
```

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_airports_iso_country_region ON `flight-data`( iso_country, iso_region )
WHERE doc_type = 'airport'
    AND iso_country IS NOT NULL
    AND iso_region IS NOT NULL
USING GSI
```

##### Query

```sql
SELECT airports.airport_id, airports.airport_name, airports.airport_type,
    airports.iso_region, airports.municipality,
    IFNULL( airports.airport_iata, airports.airport_icao, airports.airport_ident ) AS airport_code
FROM `flight-data` AS airports
WHERE airports.iso_country = 'US'
    AND airports.iso_region = 'US-VT'
    AND airports.doc_type = 'airport'
ORDER BY airports.airport_name ASC
```

##### Results

```json
[
  {
    "airport_code": "BTV",
    "airport_id": 3430,
    "airport_name": "Burlington Intl",
    "airport_type": "medium_airport",
    "iso_region": "US-VT",
    "municipality": "Burlington"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "MPV",
    "airport_id": 20551,
    "airport_name": "Edward F Knapp State",
    "airport_type": "medium_airport",
    "iso_region": "US-VT",
    "municipality": "Montpelier"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "VSF",
    "airport_id": 21336,
    "airport_name": "Hartness State",
    "airport_type": "small_airport",
    "iso_region": "US-VT",
    "municipality": "Springfield VT"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "MVL",
    "airport_id": 20575,
    "airport_name": "Morrisville Stowe State Airport",
    "airport_type": "small_airport",
    "iso_region": "US-VT",
    "municipality": "Morrisville"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "RUT",
    "airport_id": 3859,
    "airport_name": "Rutland State Airport",
    "airport_type": "medium_airport",
    "iso_region": "US-VT",
    "municipality": "Rutland"
  }
]
```

Additionally we can retrieve an aggregate count of the number of airports in a given country and region.

##### Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(1) AS total_airports
FROM `flight-data` AS airports
WHERE airports.iso_country = 'US'
    AND airports.iso_region = 'US-VT'
    AND airports.doc_type = 'airport'
```

##### Result

```json
[
  {
    "total_airports": 5
  }
]
```

## Airport Codes

The following queries allows for finding airports by their IATA, ICAO or Ident Codes.

Just like Airlines, our [Codes](/flight-data/docs/models/codes.md) model is keyed by `{{designation}}_code_{{code}}` i.e. `airport_code_ICT`.  Because of how these documents are keyed, we do not even need an index.  Using this predictive key pattern we use the code as part of the key name on the codes document.

##### Query

Query by the IATA code

```sql
SELECT airports.airport_id, airports.airport_name, airports.airport_type,
    airports.iso_region, airports.municipality,
    IFNULL( airports.airport_iata, airports.airport_icao, airports.airport_ident ) AS airport_code
FROM `flight-data` AS codes
USE KEYS 'airport_code_ICT'
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS airports ON KEYS 'airport_' || TOSTRING( codes.id )
LIMIT 1
```

Query by the ICAO code

```sql
SELECT airports.airport_id, airports.airport_name, airports.airport_type,
    airports.iso_region, airports.municipality,
    IFNULL( airports.airport_iata, airports.airport_icao, airports.airport_ident ) AS airport_code
FROM `flight-data` AS codes
USE KEYS 'airport_code_KICT'
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS airports ON KEYS 'airport_' || TOSTRING( codes.id )
LIMIT 1
```

Both queries will yield the same exact result.

##### Result

```json
[
  {
    "airport_code": "ICT",
    "airport_id": 3605,
    "airport_name": "Wichita Dwight D. Eisenhower National Airport",
    "airport_type": "large_airport",
    "iso_region": "US-KS",
    "municipality": "Wichita"
  }
]
```


### Airports by City

Lets say we wanted to search on cities in an ISO country to find associated airport codes for use within an auto-complete function on our site.

##### Index

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_airport_cities ON `flight-data`( iso_country, municipality )
WHERE doc_type = 'airport'
    AND iso_country IS NOT NULL
    AND municipality IS NOT NULL
USING GSI
```

##### Query

This query will find the airline by the 3 character IATA / FAA code

```sql
SELECT a.municipality AS city,
    IFNULL( a.airport_iata, a.airport_icao, a.airport_ident ) AS airport_code
FROM `flight-data` AS a
WHERE a.iso_country = 'US'
    AND a.municipality LIKE 'San%'
    AND a.doc_type = 'airport'
ORDER BY a.municipality ASC, a.airport_name ASC
LIMIT 5
```

##### Results

```json
[
  {
    "airport_code": "SJT",
    "city": "San Angelo"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "SKF",
    "city": "San Antonio"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "RND",
    "city": "San Antonio"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "SAT",
    "city": "San Antonio"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "SBD",
    "city": "San Bernardino"
  }
]
```

We can get the total number of matches as well:

##### Query

```sql
SELECT COUNT(1) AS matches
FROM `flight-data` AS a
WHERE a.iso_country = 'US'
    AND a.municipality LIKE 'San%'
    AND a.doc_type = 'airport'
```

##### Results

```json
[
  {
    "matches": 26
  }
]
```

We can leverage the `OFFSET` clause to paginate through the results.

##### Query

```sql
SELECT a.municipality AS city,
    IFNULL( a.airport_iata, a.airport_icao, a.airport_ident ) AS airport_code
FROM `flight-data` AS a
WHERE a.iso_country = 'US'
    AND a.municipality LIKE 'San%'
    AND a.doc_type = 'airport'
ORDER BY a.municipality ASC, a.airport_name ASC
LIMIT 5 OFFSET 5
```

##### Results

```json
[
  {
    "airport_code": "SQL",
    "city": "San Carlos"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "KNUC",
    "city": "San Clemente Island"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "SDM",
    "city": "San Diego"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "MYF",
    "city": "San Diego"
  },
  {
    "airport_code": "NZY",
    "city": "San Diego"
  }
]
```

## Airports Near a Given Airport

For this query we want to find all airports within a given radius of a given airport code.

Since we are going to be querying on the ISO Country, Latitude and Longitude of a given airport we need to create an index.

##### Index

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_airports_distance ON `flight-data`( iso_country, geo.latitude, geo.longitude )
WHERE doc_type = 'airport'
    AND iso_country IS NOT NULL
    AND geo.latitude IS NOT NULL
    AND geo.longitude IS NOT NULL
USING GSI
```

This query is based on a MySQL example provided by [Ollie Jones](http://www.plumislandmedia.net/mysql/haversine-mysql-nearest-loc/).

To perform this query we need to provide 5 pieces of information to the query, these are represented in the query below as `{{tokens}}`

##### Input

- The Source Airports
  - `iso_country` i.e. US
  - `latitude` i.e. `36.09780121`
  - `longitude` i.e. `-79.93730164`
- A `distance_unit`
  - Kilometers: 111.045
  - Miles: 69
- A `radius` in which to contain results in, i.e. `100`

##### Radius Query

```sql
SELECT results.airport_name, results.airport_code, ROUND( results.distance, 2 ) AS distance
FROM (
    SELECT airports.airport_name,
        /* assign an airport_code */
        IFNULL( airports.airport_iata, airports.airport_icao, airports.airport_ident ) AS airport_code,
        /* calculate the distance */
        {{distance_unit}} * DEGREES(ACOS(COS(RADIANS( {{source_latitude}} ))
        * COS(RADIANS( airports.geo.latitude ))
        * COS(RADIANS( {{source_longitude}} ) - RADIANS( airports.geo.longitude ))
        + SIN(RADIANS( {{source_latitude}} ))
        * SIN(RADIANS( airports.geo.latitude )))) AS distance
    FROM `flight-data` AS airports
    WHERE airports.iso_country = '{{iso_country}}'
        /* limit results to latitudes within {{distance}} north or south of the source latitude, degree of latitude is {{distance_unit}} */
        AND airports.geo.latitude BETWEEN
            {{source_latitude}} - ( {{radius}} / {{distance_unit}} )
            AND
            {{source_latitude}} + ( {{radius}} / {{distance_unit}} )
        /* limit results to longitudes within {{distance}} east or west of the source longitude, degree of longitude is {{distance_unit}} */
        AND airports.geo.longitude BETWEEN
            {{source_longitude}} - ( {{radius}} / ( {{distance_unit}} * COS(RADIANS( {{source_latitude}} ))))
            AND
            {{source_longitude}} + ( {{radius}} / ( {{distance_unit}} * COS(RADIANS( {{source_latitude}} ))))
        AND airports.doc_type = 'airport'
    ) AS results
WHERE results.distance > 0 /* remove the source from the results as its distance 0 */
    AND results.distance <= {{radius}} /* remove any of the results that are not within the radius */
ORDER BY results.distance ASC /* sort the results by closest distance */
```

To provide the source airports `iso_country`, `latitude`, and `longitude` we can use the previous Airport Codes query.

##### Source Airport Query

```sql
SELECT airports.iso_country, airports.geo.latitude AS latitude, airports.geo.longitude AS longitude
FROM `flight-data` AS codes
USE KEYS 'airport_code_ICT'
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS airports ON KEYS 'airport_' || TOSTRING( codes.id )
LIMIT 1
```

##### Result

```json
[
  {
    "iso_country": "US",
    "latitude": 37.64989853,
    "longitude": -97.43309784
  }
]
```

Next we replace the tokens from our base radius query with the returned values.

##### Airports Near a Given Airport in Miles Query

For our example we want to find any airports within 100 miles of "ICT". Our `{{distance_unit}}` is miles, this value needs to be `69` and our `{{radius}}` is `100`.  Replace the `{{source_latitude}}`, `{{source_longitude}}` and `{{iso_country}}` with the values from the previous query.

```sql
SELECT results.airport_name, results.airport_code, ROUND( results.distance, 2 ) AS distance
FROM (
    SELECT airports.airport_name,
        IFNULL( airports.airport_iata, airports.airport_icao, airports.airport_ident ) AS airport_code,
        69 * DEGREES(ACOS(COS(RADIANS( 37.64989853 ))
        * COS(RADIANS( airports.geo.latitude ))
        * COS(RADIANS( -97.43309784 ) - RADIANS( airports.geo.longitude ))
        + SIN(RADIANS( 37.64989853 ))
        * SIN(RADIANS( airports.geo.latitude )))) AS distance
    FROM `flight-data` AS airports
    WHERE airports.iso_country = 'US'
        AND airports.geo.latitude BETWEEN
            37.64989853 - (100 / 69)
            AND
            37.64989853 + (100 / 69)
        AND airports.geo.longitude BETWEEN
            -97.43309784 - (100 / (69 * COS(RADIANS( 37.64989853 ))))
            AND
            -97.43309784 + ( 100 / ( 69 * COS(RADIANS( 37.64989853 ))))
        AND airports.doc_type = 'airport'
    ) AS results
WHERE results.distance > 0
    AND results.distance <= 100
ORDER BY results.distance ASC
```

##### Airports Near a Given Airport in Kilometers Query

For our example we want to find any airports within 75 kilometers of "Berlin" (TXL). Our `{{distance_unit}}` is kilometers, this value needs to be `111.045` and our `{{radius}}` is `75`.  Replace the `{{source_latitude}}`, `{{source_longitude}}` and `{{iso_country}}` with the values from the previous query.

##### Source Airport Query

```sql
SELECT airports.iso_country, airports.geo.latitude AS latitude, airports.geo.longitude AS longitude
FROM `flight-data` AS codes
USE KEYS 'airport_code_TXL'
INNER JOIN `flight-data` AS airports ON KEYS 'airport_' || TOSTRING( codes.id )
LIMIT 1
```

##### Result

```json
